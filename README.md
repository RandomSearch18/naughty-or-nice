# Christmas naughty or nice

Mrs K's 2022 Christmas coding task 🎄

## Specification

Copied from the [Trinket course](https://krkkrk1.trinket.io/mrs-k-computing-gcse-course#/yr-11-christmas-programming/christmas-naughty-or-nice)

> The program should allow Santa to enter the name, address, postcode and total score of a child and the program should randomly decide if the child is classed as naughty or nice.
> If the total score is under 0, the child’s details should be saved to a text file called “Naughty” and if it is 0 or more, they are saved in the “Nice” text file.
> Santa will need to print his nice list in a logical order to help him deliver gifts.
> For the naughty list Santa will need to be able to send a personalised letter stating they need to be good next year.
