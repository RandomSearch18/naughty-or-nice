# Christmas naughty or nice

> The program should allow Santa to enter the name, address, postcode and total score of a child and the program should randomly decide if the child is classed as naughty or nice.

> If the total score is under 0, the child’s details should be saved to a text file called “Naughty” and if it is 0 or more, they are saved in the “Nice” text file.

> Santa will need to print his nice list in a logical order to help him deliver gifts.

> For the naughty list Santa will need to be able to send a personalised letter stating they need to be good next year.
